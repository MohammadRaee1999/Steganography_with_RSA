## Steganography with RSA
In the first part of the project, we implement and test the RSA algorithm.

In the next part, by taking a text and a photo of the user with the help of hash256 and RSA, we encrypt text in the photo.

And in the last part, by receiving the encrypted photo, we decode it and display the original text.

Also at the end are two real uses of cryptography.
